Without courage, the disciplined pursuit of less is just lip service. It is just the stuff of one more dinner party conversation. It is skin deep."}/></div>

        <br/><div><CopyText copyTextMethod={this.props.copyTextMethod} copy={"When people ask us to do something, we can confuse the request with our relationship with them. Sometimes they seem so interconnected, we forget that denying the request is not the same as denying the person. Only once we separate the decision from the relationship can we make a clear decision and then separately find the courage and compassion to communicate it."}/></div>

Yes, saying no respectfully, reasonably, and gracefully can come at a short-term social cost.

But of course this can easily became a vicious cycle: the more we invest, the more determined we become to see it through and see our investment pay off. The more we invest in something, the harder it is to let go. An essentialist has the courage and confidence to admit his or her mistakes, no matter the sunk costs."}/></div>
        <br/> <div><CopyText copyTextMethod={this.props.copyTextMethod} copy={"Beware of the endowment effect, our tendency to undervalue things that aren’t ours and to overvalue things because we already own them. A simple antidote to the endowment effect is don’t ask, “How will I feel if i miss out on this opportunity?” but rather, “If I did not have this opportunity, how much would I be willing to sacrifice in order to obtain it?”"}/></div>
        <br/><div><CopyText copyTextMethod={this.props.copyTextMethod} copy={"The Latin root of the word decision- cis or cid- literally means “to cut” or “to kill.” Every cut produces joy- maybe not in the moment but afterwards, when we realize that every additional moment we have gained can be spent on something better. That may be one reason why Stephen King has written, “To write is human, to edit is divine.”"}/></div>

What if society encouraged us to reject what has been accurately described as doing things we detest, to buy things we don't need, with money we don't have, to impress people we don't like? What if we stopped being oversold the value of having more and being undersold the value of having less? What if we stopped celebrating being busy as a measurement of importance? What if instead we celebrated how much time we have spent listening, pondering, meditating, and enjoy time with the most important people in our lives?"}/></div>

You need that level of clarity in order to innovate and grow. When I say focus, I don't mean simply picking a question or possibility and thinking about it obsessively. I mean creating the space to explore one hundred questions and possibilities. An Essentialist focuses the way our eye focus; not by fixating on something but by constantly adjusting and adapting to the field of vision."}/></div>
        <br/> <div><CopyText copyTextMethod={this.props.copyTextMethod} copy={"Setting aside some time to put a little 'Think Week' into every day. One practice I've found useful is simply to read something from classic literature. It broadens my perspective and reminds me of themes and ideas that are essential enough to have withstood the test of time. There are myriad of options. Just make sure you select something that was written before our hyperconnected era and yet seems timeless."}/></div>
        <br/> <div><CopyText copyTextMethod={this.props.copyTextMethod} copy={"The value of play in our lives can't be overstated. Play expands our minds in ways that allow us to explore: to generate new ideas or see old ideas in a new light. It makes us more inquisitive, more attuned to novelty, more engaged. It helps us challenge old assumptions and makes us more receptive to untested ideas. And play is an antidote to stress, because stress, in addition to being an enemy of productivity, can actually shut down the creative, inquisitive exploratory parts of the brain."}/></div>

One of the most common ways people-especially ambitious, successful people- damage this asset is through lack of sleep. We need to be as strategic with ourselves as we are with our careers and our businesses. We need to pace ourselves, nurture ourselves, and give ourselves fuel to explore, thrive, and perform. Bill Clinton was quoted as saying that every major mistake he had made in his life had happened as a result of sleep deprivation."}/></div>
